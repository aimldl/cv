At some point in your software development career, you may be ready for additional responsibilities. For experienced software developers who exhibit leadership skills and stay up to date on the latest technology, it may be beneficial to consider pursuing a technical lead position. Becoming a technical lead is a great way to combine your passion for technology with your management skills, and if this career interests you, it is important to understand what it entails.



### What is a technical lead?

A technical lead is a professional who oversees a team of technical personnel at a software or technology company. They often lead software development or software engineering teams and troubleshoot technical issues that involve software development, engineering tasks and product releases.

A technical lead needs to have a great deal of professional experience in software development and a deep understanding of technology, but they should also be personable and capable enough to effectively lead a team and collaborate with others.

## What does a technical lead do?

A technical lead is responsible for the following tasks:

- Hiring and training technical personnel
- Delegating work and assignments to team members
- Collaborating with their team to identify and fix technical problems
- Analyzing users' needs and then finding applications to serve them
- Creating end goals for their team
- Checking that software and applications are updated
- Supervising system modifications
- Conducting security audits to identify areas of improvement
- Guiding their team through technical issues and challenges

## Technical lead vs. engineering manager

When deciding whether to become a technical lead or an engineering manager, it is important to consider the differences between the roles. While professionals in both positions need to have strong leadership and software development skills, the main difference is that a technical lead is more focused on technology than people management.

A technical lead is responsible for helping their team members with the technical aspects of their jobs, such as coding and programming. They may also explain new projects to their team and troubleshoot any problems that occur. In comparison, an engineering manager is more focused on managing their employees. They are responsible for business growth and team deadlines, among other things, and they typically serve as their team's representative to the rest of the company.

As an engineering manager, you need to have excellent people management skills and be able to assess your team's long-term goals, while you are more likely to work hands-on and focus on day-to-day tasks as a technical lead.

1. Earn a bachelor's degree.
