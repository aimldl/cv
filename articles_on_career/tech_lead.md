## Technical lead vs. engineering manager

When deciding whether to become a technical lead or an engineering manager, it is important to consider the differences between the roles. While professionals in both positions need to have strong leadership and software development skills, the main difference is that a technical lead is more focused on technology than people management.

A technical lead is responsible for helping their team members with the technical aspects of their jobs, such as coding and programming. They may also explain new projects to their team and troubleshoot any problems that occur. In comparison, an engineering manager is more focused on managing their employees. They are responsible for business growth and team deadlines, among other things, and they typically serve as their team's representative to the rest of the company.

As an engineering manager, you need to have excellent people management skills and be able to assess your team's long-term goals, while you are more likely to work hands-on and focus on day-to-day tasks as a technical lead.
